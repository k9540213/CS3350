This Software describes the architecture and system design of the Employee Management System for Company.
The system replaces the manual process of managing employee data, previously handled by a single HR admin using dBeaver and MySQL scripts. 
The system streamlines operations such as searching, updating, adding employees, managing salaries, and generating reports.
