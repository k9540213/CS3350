This Software Design Document (SDD) describes the architecture and system design of the Employee Management System for Company Z.
The system replaces the manual process of managing employee data, previously handled by a single HR admin using dBeaver and MySQL scripts. 
The system streamlines operations such as searching, updating, adding employees, managing salaries, and generating reports.
